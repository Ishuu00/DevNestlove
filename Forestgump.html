    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        <b>Forrest Gump</b> is a 1994 American comedy-drama film directed by Robert Zemeckis. An adaptation of the 1986 novel by Winston Groom,   the screenplay of the film is written by Eric Roth. It stars Tom Hanks in the title role, alongside Robin Wright, Gary Sinise,   Mykelti Williamson, and Sally Field in lead roles. <i><u>The film follows the life of an Alabama man named Forrest Gump (Hanks)</u></i> and his experiences in the 20th-century United States.

        Principal photography took place between August and December 1993, mainly in Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina. Extensive visual effects were used to incorporate Hanks into archived footage and to develop other scenes. The soundtrack features songs reflecting the different periods seen in the film. Various interpretations have been made of the protagonist and the film's political symbolism.
        
        Forrest Gump was released in the United States on July 6, 1994, and received widespread critical acclaim for Zemeckis's direction, performances (particularly those of Hanks and Sinise), visual effects, music, and screenplay. The film was a major success at the box office: it became the top-grossing film in the United States released that year and earned over <u>US$678.2</u> million worldwide during its theatrical run, making it the second-highest-grossing film of 1994, behind The Lion King. The soundtrack sold over 12 million copies. Forrest Gump won six Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor for Hanks, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Visual Effects, and Best Film Editing. It received many award nominations, including Golden Globes, British Academy Film Awards, and Screen Actors Guild Awards.
        
        In 2011, the Library of Congress selected the film for preservation in the United States National Film Registry as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"

    <h2>Plot</h2>
    <pre style="font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;">
In 1981, a feather lands at a bus stop in Savannah, Georgia, where a man named Forrest Gump recounts his life story to 
strangers who sit next to him on a bench.
In the 1950s, in Greenbow, Alabama, young Forrest is fitted with leg braces to correct a curved spine, and cannot walk properly. 
He lives alone with his mother, who runs a boarding house out of their home that attracts many tenants, including a young Elvis Presley, who plays the guitar for Forrest and incorporates Forrest's jerky dance 
movements into his performances. On his first day of school, 
Forrest meets a girl named Jenny Curran, and the two become best friends. Forrest is often bullied because of his physical disability and low intelligence. While fleeing from several bullies, his leg braces 
break off, revealing Forrest to be a very fast runner. This talent eventually allows him to receive a football scholarship at the University of Alabama in 1963, where he is coached by Bear Bryant, and 
witnesses Governor George Wallace's Stand in the Schoolhouse Door, during which he returns a dropped book to Vivian Malone Jones. Forrest becomes a top kick returner, is named to the
All-American team, and meets President John F. Kennedy at the White House.
